# Identifying Dogs
This is an end-to-end Object Detection project that classifies and localizes different breeds of dogs.
Since this is an end-to-end project, it will cover every step from data acquisition to model deployment into an Android app.

## Prerequisites

* Amazon account
* Android Studio
* Root User for billing
* IAM User for using AWS SageMaker

## Assumptions

I'm assuming you have some understanding of what AWS, Deep Learning, and Object Detection are and how they work. 

I'm also assuming you like dogs.
