# Objective
The purpose of this project is to train, test, and deploy an Object Detection model that classifies and localizes different breeds of dogs in an image taken with an Android phone. This will cover every step from data acquisition to model deployment into a custom Android app. For the sake of brevity, I'll only be using 5 breeds (German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Border Collies, Pugs, and Beagles) although this can be extended to as many as you want.

## Prerequisites

* AWS Root User
* AWS IAM User
* Android Studio

## Assumptions

I'm assuming you have some understanding of what AWS, Deep Learning, and Object Detection are and how they work. 

I'm also assuming you like dogs.
