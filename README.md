# Identifying Dogs
This is an end-to-end Object Detection project that classifies and localizes different breeds of dogs.
Since this is an end-to-end project, it will cover every step from data acquisition to model deployment into an Android app.

## Prerequisites

* Amazon account
* Android Studio
* Python 3
* Fatkun Batch Downloader
* Roboflow.ai

## Problem Statement

This is an educational project that, with enough data, can become more practical in use. It's not always easy to tell the breed of a dog, either because some breeds overlap physical traits or the name might slip the mind. The end goal of this project (which is subject to change depending on how robust of a model can be made) is to build, train, and deploy an Object Detection model that can classify and localize different breeds of dogs in a picture taken through an android app.
