# Data Collection
After determining a problem statement or object, the next step in any ML/DL problem is to understand the data that will be gathered, and to ensure that it's expansive enough to provide as robust of a model as possible.

## Characteristics of the Data

Since this is a multi-classifcation problem, there needs to be enough data for each "class" or breed of dog. This requires not only enough images of each breed, but with enough variety and diversity that the model can generalize well during inference.
This would imply some images with:
* Multiple dogs (both same and different breeds)
* Breeds with different physical traits (e.g. Black and red vs all white German Shepherds)
* With and without humans
* Various settings (contrast against a snowy background vs a living room)
